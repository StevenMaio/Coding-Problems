# Problem 3
Given the root to a binary tree, implement serialize(root), which serializes
the tree into a string, and deserialize(s), which deserializes the string
back into the tree.

### Solution
To use this solution, enter `python problem3.py in out` the program will then
take a tree in file `in`, turn it into a tree, and then serialize it again in
the file whose name is `out`.
