# Problem 86
Given a string of parentheses, write a function to compute the minimum 
number of parentheses to be removed to make the string valid (i.e. each 
open parenthesis is eventually closed).

### Solution
To use this solution, enter `python problem86.py s`, where `s` refers to
a sequence of open and close parenthesis. It's worth noting that `s` must
be enclosed in quotation marks.
