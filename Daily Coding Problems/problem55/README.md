# Problem 55
Implement a URL shortener with the following methods:

-`shorten(url)`, which shortens the url into a six-character alphanumeric
string, such as zLg6wl.

-`restore(short)`, which expands the shortened string into the original url.
If no such shortened string exists, return null.

Hint: What if we enter the same URL twice?
