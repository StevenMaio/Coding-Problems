# Problem 71
Using a function rand7() that returns an integer from 1 to 7 (inclusive)
with uniform probability, implement a function rand5() that returns an
integer from 1 to 5 (inclusive).

### Using this solution
Type into the command line `python problem71.py n`. The program will then
call `rand5()` `n` times and print each result.
