# Problem 155

Given a list of elements, find the majority element, which appears more than
half the times (> floor(len(lst) / 2.0)).

You can assume that such element exists.

For example, given [1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 4, 0], return 1.

## Solution

To use this solution, enter `python problem155.py l` wherein `l` is the
lsit of elements.
