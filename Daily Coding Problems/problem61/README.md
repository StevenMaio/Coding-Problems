# Problem 61
Implement integer exponentiation. That is, implement the pow(x, y) function, 
where x and y are integers and returns x^y.

Do this faster than the naive method of repeated multiplication.

### This Solution
To use this solution, type `python problem61.py x y` into the terminal. The
program will then calculate `exp(x, y)` and print only how long it took to
compute using the naive method, and the recursive method.
