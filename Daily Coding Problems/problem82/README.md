# Problem 82
Using a `read7()` method that returns `7` characters from a file, implement
`readN(n)` which reads `n` characters.

For example, given a file with the content `"Hello world"`, three `read7()`
returns `"Hello w"`, `"orld"` and then `""`.

### Solution
To use this solution, first compile `problem82.c`. Once the program is 
compiled, enter into the terminal `a.exe filename n` where `filename`
refers to the name of the file to be read, and `n` is described above.
