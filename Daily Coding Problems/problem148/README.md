# Problem 148

Gray code is a binary code where each successive value differ in only one
bit, as well as when wrapping around. Gray code is common in hardware so
that we don't see temporary spurious values during transitions.

Given a number of bits `n`, generate a possible gray code for it.

For example, for `n = 2`, one gray code would be `[00, 01, 11, 10]`.

## Solution

To use this solution, enter `python problem148.py n`, wherein `n` is
described in the problem.
