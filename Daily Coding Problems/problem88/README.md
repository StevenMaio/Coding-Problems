# Problem 88
Implement division of two positive integers without using the division, 
multiplication, or modulus operators. Return the quotient as an integer, 
ignoring the remainder.

### Solution
To use this solution, enter `python problem88.py x y` and then the solution
will print the quotient of `x` divided by `y`.
