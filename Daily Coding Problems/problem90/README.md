# Problem 90
Given an integer n and a list of integers l, write a function that randomly 
generates a number from 0 to n-1 that isn't in l (uniform).

### Solution
To use this solution, type `python problem90.py n a_1 a_2 ... a_n` where `n` 
is described above, and each `a_i` is an element in the list.
