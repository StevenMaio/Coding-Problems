# Problem 103
Given a string and a set of characters, return the shortest substring
containing all the characters in the set.

For example, given the string `"figehaeci"` and the set of characters
`{a, e, i}`, you should return `"aeci"`.

If there is no substring containing all the characters in the set,
return null.

## Solution
To use this solution, enter `python problem103.py s c_1 c_2 ...` where
`s` refers to the string, and `c_i` is a character in the set of
characters.
