# Problem 125

Given the root of a binary search tree, and a target K, return two nodes
in the tree whose sum equals K.

## Solution

To use this solution, enter `python problem125.py filename k` wherein
`filename` is the file containing the tree and `k` is the desired sum.

This solution runs in linear time, and does not take advantage of the
structure of a binary search tree. I'll come back to this later and make
it more efficient.
