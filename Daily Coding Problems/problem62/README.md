# Problem 62
There is an N by M matrix of zeroes. Given N and M, write a function to 
count the number of ways of starting at the top-left corner and getting 
to the bottom-right corner. You can only move right or down.

### Using this program
To run this program, type into the terminal `python problem62.py m n` where 
`m` represents the number of rows in the matrix, and `n` represents the 
number of columns.
