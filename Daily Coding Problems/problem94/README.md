# Problem 94
Given a binary tree of integers, find the maximum path sum between two 
nodes. The path must go through at least one node, and does not need to 
go through the root.

## Solution
To use this solution, enter `python problem94.py filename s t` where
`filename` refers to the file whose content is the data for the binary 
tree, and `s` and `t` refer to the start and end nodes respectively.
