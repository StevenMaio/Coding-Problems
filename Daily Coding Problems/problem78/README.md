# Problem 78
Given k sorted singly linked lists, write a function to merge all the lists 
into one sorted singly linked list.

## Solution
TO use this solution, type into the terminal `python problem78.py 
l_1 l_2 ... l_n` where each `l_i` corresponds to a list of integers formated
like `a_1,a_2,...,a_n`. This isn't 100% to the problem, but the idea is the
same.
