# Problem 63
Given a 2D matrix of characters and a target word, write a function that 
returns whether the word can be found in the matrix by going left-to-right, 
or up-to-down.

### Running this solution
You can run this solution from the command line via `python problem63.py X Y_1 Y_2 .. Y_n.`
where `X` refers to the word you wish to find and `Y_i` refers to the ith row
of the matrix.
