# Problem 84
Given a matrix of 1s and 0s, return the number of "islands" in the matrix.
A 1 represents land and 0 represents water, so an island is a group of 1s
that are neighboring and their perimiter is surrounded by water.

For example, this matrix has 4 islands.

	1 0 0 0 0
	0 0 1 1 0
	0 1 1 0 0
	0 0 0 0 0
	1 1 0 0 1
	1 1 0 0 1

## Solution
To use this solution, enter `python problem84.py filename` where `filename`
is the name of the file whose content is a matrix described in the problem.
