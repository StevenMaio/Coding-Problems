# Problem 126

Write a function that rotates a list by k elements. For example,
`[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` rotated by two becomes `[3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2]`. Try
solving this without creating a copy of the list. How many swap or move
operations do you need?

## Solution

To use this solution, enter `python problem126.py k l` wherein `k` as
described above, and `l` is a list using comma seperated values.
