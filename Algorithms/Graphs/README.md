# Graphs
This directory will contain some algorithms on graphs.

## Directed Graph
You can find some algorithims in the file `directed_graph.py`. You can 
construct a directed graph using a list of nodes, and a list of tuples.

The file cames with a `main` function, which will create a directed graph 
a list of nodes (values are possible), and a list of tuples representing
edges. To use this, enter into the terminal `python directed_graph.py 
0,1,...,n i,j ... a,b'.
