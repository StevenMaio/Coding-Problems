# Problem 74
Suppose you have a multiplication table that is N by N. That is, a 2D array 
where the value at the i-th row and j-th column is (i + 1) * (j + 1) 
(if 0-indexed) or i * j (if 1-indexed).

Given integers N and X, write a function that returns the number of times 
X appears as a value in an N by N multiplication table.

### This Solution
To use this solution, type `python problem74.py n x` where `n` corresponds 
to N in the problem and `x` corresponds to X.
