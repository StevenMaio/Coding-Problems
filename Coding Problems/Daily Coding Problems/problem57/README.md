# Problem 57
Given a string s and an integer k, break up the string into multiple texts 
such that each text has a length of k or less. You must break it up so 
that words don't break across lines. If there's no way to break the text up, 
then return null.

You can assume that there are no spaces at the ends of the string and that 
there is exactly one space between each word.

### Running this solution
To run this solution, type into the command line `python3 problem57.py k x`,
where `k` is the value of the paramter in the descrtiption, and `x` refers
to the string being broken apart.
