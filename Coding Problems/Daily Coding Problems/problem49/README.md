# Problem 49
Given an array of numbers, find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray 
of the array.

To be honest, I'm not 100% certain this works, it's given me good results,
and I feel strongly that it works, but that's not the most satisfying
answer.

### Running this solution
To run this solution, type `python3 problem49.py x_1 x_2 ... x_n` into the
terminal, where `x_i` represents the i-th element in the array.
