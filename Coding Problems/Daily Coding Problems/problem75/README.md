# Problem 75
Given an array of numbers, find the length of the longest increasing 
subsequence in the array. The subsequence does not necessarily have to 
be contiguous.

### Solution
To use this solution, typer `python problem75.py a_1 a_2 ... a_n` where 
`a_i` corresponds to the i-th element in the array.
